# Xtractor

Xtractor is a simple script written in python to **bulk extract download links** for TV series from [`todaytvseries.com`](https://www.todaytvseries1.com). This allows you to avoid link shortener ads and use download managers like [**IDM**](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com) or [**FDM**](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org) to download episodes in bulk instead of one by one.

## Why should i use Xtractor
